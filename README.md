# Algorithm-visualiser
A web-based Algorithm Visualizer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help students understand and visualize algorithms and their workings interactively. It simplifies learning by showing step-by-step execution of sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.

**🚀 Overview:**

Understanding algorithms can be challenging when limited to textbook explanations. This project provides a visual learning experience for popular sorting, searching, and graph algorithms, empowering users to step through each operation in real-time.

Whether you're a beginner learning algorithms or a teacher explaining concepts, this tool bridges the gap between theory and practice.

**✨ Features:**

🔁 Sorting Algorithms Visualization:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

**🔍 Searching Algorithms Visualization:**

Linear Search

Binary Search

🐢⚡ Adjustable Animation Speed
Users can control how fast or slow the algorithm animates to match their learning pace.

🎨 Color-coded Steps
Clearly highlights comparisons, swaps, and final positions for easy understanding.

📱 Responsive User Interface
Works smoothly across devices – desktop, tablet, or mobile.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**

HTML – Structure and layout of the web app

CSS – Styling and responsive design

JavaScript – Logic and animation of algorithms

**🎯 Future Enhancements:**

Add more algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Dijkstra’s, BFS/DFS

Theme switch (Dark/Light Mode)

Graph algorithm visualizations

Export animations as GIFs for learning materials
