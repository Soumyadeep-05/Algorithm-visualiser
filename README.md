# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

This project is an interactive *web-based algorithm visualizer* designed to make learning algorithms intuitive and engaging. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the tool allows students and educators to visualize the step-by-step execution of popular sorting, searching, and (planned) graph algorithms. By turning abstract processes into animated sequences, this visualizer helps bridge the gap between theory and practical understanding.

Whether you're new to algorithms or teaching them, this tool provides a hands-on approach for exploring algorithm logic and behavior in real time.

## Features

- *Sorting Algorithms Visualization*
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort

- *Searching Algorithms Visualization*
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

- *Adjustable Animation Speed*
  - Intuitive sliders let users control the speed of animations to suit individual learning paces.

- *Color-coded Steps*
  - Operations such as comparisons, swaps, and sorted positions are highlighted with distinct colors for clear comprehension.

- *Responsive User Interface*
  - Seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices for accessible learning anywhere.

## Tech Stack

- *HTML:* Structures the layout and user interface.
- *CSS:* Ensures attractive visuals and responsive design across devices.
- *JavaScript:* Powers the algorithm logic, visualization steps, and animations.

## How It Works

1. *Select an Algorithm*
   - Choose from supported sorting or searching algorithms.
2. *Provide Input*
   - Enter or randomize array values for sorting/searching.
3. *Visualize*
   - Step through the algorithm with play, pause, and speed controls while watching color-coded operations animate in real time.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Dijkstraâ€™s, BFS/DFS
- Theme switching (Dark/Light mode)
- Graph algorithm visualizations
- Export animations as GIFs for educational use
